# Assessing-the-Impact-of-Air-Pollution-on-Asthma-Prevalence-in-Los-Angeles

## Motivation
a) Extract the relationship between air pollution and Asthma, especially focusing on Los Angeles.
b) The result obtained from this analysis can be valuable insights for public health organizations for policy making.

## Problem Description
a) Find what are the major causes of air pollution in LA.
b) Determine how the rise in air degradation has impacted human health causing Asthma in Los Angeles.
c) Display the correlation between air pollution and Asthma.

## Solution
a) Past data regarding the Air Quality and hospitalization of patients are collected from various sources to see the trend of these parameters. 
b)These data are analyzed and represented using various diagrams to provide a visual representation.

## Findings
a) Impact of PM 2.5 air quality to increase air pollution in LA with some outliers.
b) Trends in air quality over the years do determine temporary or long-term patterns. 
c) Major correlation between the air quality and Asthma 

## Problem Definition
Does the air pollution in LA cause asthma cases (respiratory disease) to increase?

## Experimental Results demonstrating/proving(Test Performed)
a) Correlation Analysis: Determine some statistical link between air pollution and asthma. 
b) Regression Analysis: Determine the impact on our Asthma (dependent variable) when there is a change in air pollution(Independent Variable)
c) Trend Analysis: Determines the movement of air pollution with certain seasonal patterns.

## Conclusion
a) In general, the analysis also indicates a high level of PM 2.5 at the beginning of every year. 
b) Although there are some exceptions, this survey is proof of a positive correlation between air pollution and respiratory health
c) Los Angeles' PM2.5 levels rise, raising asthma hospitalization rates.

## Challenges   
a) The quality of data and its availability was a bit less which made the process of data analysis challenging.
b) Considering all the other factors of air pollution requires a lot of time and effort. Our analysis only relies on the PM 2.5 air quality index for most of our analysis.

## Lesson Learned	and Future direction
a) This analysis emphasizes the importance of air quality to improve the cases of respiratory diseases like Asthma. 
b) Proper policy and community awareness regarding air quality issues can be conducted.
c) Implementation of advanced technology and big data for comprehensive analysis.
d) Real-time data noise could be devised to notify people living in the area when high-risk days occur.
